    The new note is simply pushed to the end of the notes.
    This means you can see more than the normal amount of notes on the page.
    When you refresh the page, the topmost note will be gone,
    deleted from the server.
end note

Client->Server: HTTP POST new note to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
Server-->Client: 201 CREATED JSON: {"message":"note created"}
Client->User: Client console logs response text

note over Client
    This process does not fetch the updated notes from the server,
    so things may look different than you think when you refresh.
end note
